The data is obtained from the United Nations Comtrade: 
     comtrade.un.org/data/,
 by selecting the following configuration:
    Type of Product: goods
    Frequency: monthly
    Periods: all of 2014
    Reporter: United Kingdom
    Partners: all
    Flows: imports and exports
    HS (as reported) commodity codes: 
            0401 (Milk and cream, neither concentrated nor sweetened)
            0402 (Milk and    cream, concentrated or sweetened)
Clicking on 'Preview' results in a message that the data exceeds 500 rows.
 Data was downloaded using the Download CSV button and the download file 
 renamed appropriately.

Exercise 3: Experimenting with Split-Apply-Combine â€“ Summary reports
Aggegration operations can be invoked using the aggregate() method.
to find the total value of imports traded for each commodity within
 the period, take the world dataframe, and sum the values over the 
 trade value column within each grouping.
